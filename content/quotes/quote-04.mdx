Ooooh  
Spend my life with you  
Spend my life with you  
Spend my life with you  
Can you feel our chemistry?  
I want you to be my remedy  
Baby you know now  
Baby I know  
Nothing but destiny  
All this time, you were meant for me  
Baby you know now  
Baby I know  
You give rise to this melody  
No need to disagree  
Baby you know now (She's my queen forever)  
Baby I know (She's my queen she's mine)  
Can you feel our chemistry?  
I want you to be my remedy  
Baby you know now (She's my queen forever)  
Baby I know (She's my queen she's mine)  
She's my queen forever  
She's my queen she's mine  
She's my queen forever  
She's my queen  
I'm ready to see diamonds, It's the root  
And I'm trying to be elegant in my suit  
I can see you in the jungle  
Sky is red  
I'll be there when you stumble just like I said  
But I lack all the eloquence to assure this pursuit  
And I'm trying to be elegant for you  
But this is just who we are  
How we plan to remain  
Ready for the day when you choose my name  
She's my queen forever  
She's my queen she's mine  
She's my queen forever  
She's my queen  
I got that red letter settlement straight out the ink  
We got that bath water deficit and wax on the sink  
We drink champagne in the swimming pool our fingers are wrinkled  
We drink champagne in the hotel room the headboard is crinkled  
We got candles and roses  
Nicotine and hypnosis  
We got candles and roses  
Pretty love per prognosis  
We gone worship the lotus  
Put our gears into motion  
They gone call holy motors  
How we rollin' and rollin'  
In your blood  
It's like I'm running in  
Your brain
