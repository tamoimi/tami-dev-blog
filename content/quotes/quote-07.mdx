I know you tried  
I know you tried your best  
And now it's time to put this all to rest  
Minutes pass and those days seem long ago, oh-oh  
A distant voice  
One that I used to know  
There's a voice and it's tryin' to drag me down, down  
If you go then I'm goin' with you now  
Don't look back  
Nothin' left to see  
Just leave the shadows in the past  
If I let it go  
Can I shake this feelin'?  
Oh-oh-oh  
Just like that  
Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back  
I can feel you, though  
Wake me from this dreamin'  
Flip the switch  
You're keepin' me in the dark  
My vision's clear, I see ya left a mark  
I'm the voice and I won't let you drag me down, down  
If you go, I'm not goin' with you now  
Don't look back  
Nothin' left to see  
Just leave the shadows in the past  
If I let it go  
Can I shake this feelin'?  
Oh-oh-oh  
Just like that  
Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back  
I can feel you, though  
Wake me from this dreamin'  
Wake me from this dreamin
